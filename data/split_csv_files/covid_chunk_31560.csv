First lets start by reading this:

Lets discuss the threat of COVID at this point. It is not specifically just deaths that are concerning. It is not even severity of symptoms. It is health care system overload. Let me elaborate in the next tweet.

Even if we had a 99% contagious strain/variant of the Common Cold, the economic and social ramifications. How so? Because millions would be unable to work. Millions would seek Primary or Urgent Medical system care.

We are clearly seeing the virus evolve to become less deadly and more contagious. This is good news and bad. Good because less deaths. Bad because see above.

It is clear that the current vaccine does perhaps a single thing to #Omicron: Reduction of symptom severity. So people should still get vaccines.

With potentially millions sick, this will further disrupt the economy, supply chain, and schooling. But the current vaccine can only be relied upon to potentially reduce symptoms and some minor transmission.
